# Additive Synthesis
Instrument based on additive synthesis with SuperCollider synthesis and Processing GUI.
From the GUI it's possible to control amplitude, attack and release of 8 formants that are the first 8 multiples of the fundamental. Additionally, it's possible to control volume and pan of the entire synth, and a simple reverb.
